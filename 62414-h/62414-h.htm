<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">INTRODUCTION.</span></h2>
<p>Before entering upon a description of the restorations of the
Extinct Animals, placed on the Geological Islands in the great
Lake, a brief account may be premised of the principles and procedures
adopted in carrying out this attempt to present a view of
part of the animal creation of former periods in the earth&rsquo;s
history.</p>
<p>Those extinct animals were first selected of which the entire,
or nearly entire, skeleton had been exhumed in a fossil state. To
accurate drawings of these skeletons an outline of the form of the
entire animal was added, according to the proportions and relations
of the skin and adjacent soft parts to the superficial parts of
the skeleton, as yielded by those parts in the nearest allied living
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
animals. From such an outline of the exterior, Mr. Waterhouse
Hawkins prepared at once a miniature model form in clay.</p>
<p>This model was rigorously tested in regard to all its proportions
with those exhibited by the bones and joints of the skeleton of
the fossil animal, and the required alterations and modifications
were successively made, after repeated examinations and comparisons,
until the result proved satisfactory.</p>
<p>The next step was to make a copy in clay of the proof model,
of the natural size of the extinct animal: the largest known
fossil bone, or part, of such animal being taken as the standard
according to which the proportions of the rest of the body were
calculated agreeably with those of the best preserved and most
perfect skeleton. The model of the full size of the extinct animal
having been thus prepared, and corrected by renewed comparisons
with the original fossil remains, a mould of it was prepared, and a
cast taken from this mould, in the material of which the restorations,
now exposed to view, are composed.</p>
<p>There are some very rare and remarkable extinct animals of
which only the fossil skull and a few detached bones of the
skeleton have been discovered: in most of these the restoration
has been limited to the head, as, for example, in the case of the
Mosasaurus; and only in two instances&mdash;those, viz., of the
Labyrinthodon and Dicynodon&mdash;has Mr. Hawkins taken upon
himself the responsibility of adding the trunk to the known
characters of the head, such addition having been made to illustrate
the general affinities and nature of the fossil, and the kind
of limbs required to produce the impressions of the footprints,
where these have been detected and preserved in the petrified
sands of the ancient sea-shores trodden by these strange forms of
the Reptilian class.</p>
<p>With regard to the hair, the scales, the scutes, and other modifications
of the skin, in some instances the analogy of the nearest
allied living forms of animals has been the only guide; in a few
instances, as in that of the Ichthyosaurus, portions of the petrified
integument have been fortunately preserved, and have guided
the artist most satisfactorily in the restoration of the skin and soft
parts of the fins; in the case of other reptiles, the bony plates,
spines, and scutes have been discovered in a fossil state, and have
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
been scrupulously copied in the attempt to restore the peculiar
tegumentary features of the extinct reptiles, as <i>e.g.</i> in the
Hyl&aelig;osaurus.</p>
<p>In every stage of this difficult, and by some it may be thought,
perhaps, too bold, attempt to reproduce and present to human
gaze and contemplation the forms of animal life that have successively
flourished during former geological phases of time, and have
passed away long ages prior to the creation of man, the writer of
the following brief notice of the nature and affinities of the
animals so restored feels it a duty, as it is a high gratification to
him, to testify to the intelligence, zeal, and peculiar artistic skill
by which his ideas and suggestions have been realised and carried
out by the talented director of the fossil department, Mr. Waterhouse
Hawkins. Without the combination of science, art, and
manual skill, happily combined in that gentleman, the present
department of the Instructive Illustrations at the Crystal Palace
could not have been realised.</p>
<h3 id="c2"><span class="sc">The Secondary Island.</span></h3>
<p>The most cursory observation of the surface of the earth
shows that it is composed of distinct substances, such as clay,
chalk, lias, limestone, coal, slate, sandstone, &amp;c.; and a study
of such substances, their relative position and contents, has
led to the conviction that these external parts of the earth have
acquired their present condition gradually, under a variety of
circumstances, and at successive periods, during which many races
of animated beings, distinct both from those of other periods and
from those now living, have successively peopled the land and the
waters; the remains of these creatures being found buried in
many of the layers or masses of mineral substances, forming the
crust of the earth.</p>
<p>The object of the Islands in the Geological Lake is to demonstrate
the order of succession, or superposition, of these layers or
strata, and to exhibit, restored in form and bulk, as when they
lived, the most remarkable and characteristic of the extinct
animals and plants of each stratum.</p>
<p>The series of mineral substances and strata represented in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
smaller island have been called by geologists &ldquo;secondary formations,&rdquo;
because they lie between an older series termed &ldquo;primary,&rdquo; and
a newer series termed &ldquo;tertiary:&rdquo; the term &ldquo;formation&rdquo; meaning
any assemblage of rocks or layers which have some character in
common, whether of origin, age, or composition.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Following the secondary formations as they descend in the
earth, or succeed each other from above downwards, and as they
are shown, obliquely tilted up out of their original level position
from left to right, in the Secondary Island, they consist: 1st, of
the Chalk or Cretaceous group; 2nd, the Wealden; 3rd, the
Oolite; 4th, the Lias; and 5th, the New Red Sandstone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small"><span class="ss">THE CHALK.</span></span></h2>
<p>The chalk formations or &ldquo;cretaceous group of beds&rdquo; include
strata of various mineral substances; but the white chalk which
forms the cliffs of Dover and the adjoining coasts, and the downs
and chalk quarries of the South of England, is the chief and most
characteristic formation. Chalk, immense as are the masses in
which it has been deposited, owes its origin to living actions;
every particle of it once circulated in the blood or vital juices of
certain species of animals, or of a few plants, that lived in the
seas of the secondary period of geological time. White chalk consists
of carbonate of lime, and is the result of the decomposition
chiefly of coral-animals (<i>Madrepores</i>, <i>Millepores</i>, <i>Flustra</i>, <i>Cellepora</i>,
&amp;c.), of sea-urchins (<i>Echini</i>), and of shell-fishes (<i>Testacea</i>), and of
the mechanical reduction, pounding, and grinding of their shells.
Such chalk-forming beings still exist, and continue their operations
in various parts of the ocean, especially in the construction of
coral reefs and islands.</p>
<p>Every river that traverses a limestone district carries into the
sea a certain proportion of caustic lime in solution: the ill effects
of the accumulation of this mineral are neutralised by the power
allotted to the above-cited sea-animals to absorb the lime, combine
it with carbonic-acid, and precipitate or deposit it in the condition
of insoluble chalk, or carbonate of lime.</p>
<p>The entire cretaceous series includes from above downwards:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Maestricht beds of yellowish chalk.</p>
<p class="t0">Upper white chalk with flints.</p>
<p class="t0">Lower white chalk without flints.</p>
<p class="t0">Upper green-sand.</p>
<p class="t0">Gault.</p>
<p class="t0">Lower green-sand and Kentish rag.</p>
</div>
<p>The best known and most characteristic large extinct animal of
the chalk formations is chiefly found in the uppermost and most
recent division, and is called</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<h3 id="c4">No. 1.&mdash;<span class="sc">The Mosasaurus.</span>
<br />(<i>Mosasaurus Hoffmanni</i>, Hoffmann&rsquo;s Mosasaur.)</h3>
<p>Of this animal almost the entire skull has been discovered, but
not sufficient of the rest of the skeleton to guide to a complete
restoration of the animal. The head only, therefore, is shown, of
the natural size, at the left extremity of the Secondary Island.</p>
<p>The first or generic name of this animal is derived from the
locality, Maestricht, on the river Meuse (Lat. <i>Mosa</i>), in Germany,
where its remains have been chiefly discovered, and from the
Greek word <i>sauros</i>, a lizard, to which tribe of animals it belongs.
Its second name refers to its discoverer, Dr. Hoffmann, of Maestricht,
surgeon to the forces quartered in that town in 1780.
This gentleman had occupied his leisure by the collection of the
fossils from the quarries which were then worked to a great extent
at Maestricht for a kind of yellowish stone of a chalky nature,
and belonging to the most recent of the secondary class of formations
in geology. In one of the great subterraneous quarries or
galleries, about five hundred paces from the entrance, and ninety
feet below the surface, the quarrymen exposed part of the skull of
the Mosasaurus, in a block of stone which they were engaged in
detaching. On this discovery they suspended their work, and
went to inform Dr. Hoffmann, who, on arriving at the spot,
directed the operations of the men, so that they worked out the
block without injury to the fossil; and the doctor then, with his
own hands, cleared away the matrix and exposed the jaws and
teeth, casts of which are shown in the cretaceous rock of the
Island.</p>
<p>This fine specimen, which Hoffmann had added with so much
pains and care to his collection, soon, however, became a source
of chagrin to him. One of the canons of the cathedral at
Maestricht, who owned the surface of the soil beneath which was
the quarry whence the fossil had been obtained, when the fame
of the specimen reached him, pleaded certain feudal rights to
it. Hoffmann resisted, and the canon went to law. The
Chapter supported the canon, and the decree ultimately went
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
against the poor surgeon, who lost both his specimen and his
money&mdash;being made to pay the costs of the action. The canon
did not, however, long enjoy possession of the unique specimen.
When the French army bombarded Maestricht in 1795, directions
were given to spare the suburb in which the famous fossil was
known to be preserved; and after the capitulation of the town it
was seized and borne off in triumph. The specimen has since
remained in the museum of the Garden of Plants at Paris.</p>
<p>This skull of the Mosasaurus measures four and a half feet
long and two and a half feet wide. The large pointed teeth on the
jaws are very conspicuous; but, in addition to these, the gigantic
reptile had teeth on a bone of the roof of the mouth (the pterygoid),
like some of the modern lizards. The entire length of the animal has
been estimated at about thirty feet. It is conjectured to have been
able to swim well, and to have frequented the sea in quest of prey:
its dentition shows its predatory and carnivorous character, and its
remains have hitherto been met with exclusively in the chalk formations.
Besides the specimens from St. Peter&rsquo;s Mount, Maestricht,
of which the above-described skull is the most remarkable, fossil
bones and teeth of the Mosasaurus have been found in the chalk
of Kent, and in the green-sand&mdash;a member of the cretaceous
series&mdash;in New Jersey, United States of America. No animal
like the Mosasaurus is now known to exist.</p>
<h3 id="c5">Nos. 2 &amp; 3.&mdash;<span class="sc">The Pterodactyle.</span></h3>
<p>Nos. 2 and 3 are restorations of a flying reptile or dragon,
called Pterodactyle, from the Greek words <i>pteron</i>, a wing, and
<i>dactylos</i>, a finger; because the wings are mainly supported by the
outer finger, enormously lengthened and of proportionate strength,
which, nevertheless, answers to the little finger of the human hand.
The wings consisted of folds of skin, like the leather wings of the
bat; and the Pterodactyles were covered with scales, not with
feathers: the head, though somewhat resembling in shape that of
a bird, and supported on a long and slender neck, was provided
with long jaws, armed with teeth; and altogether the structure of
these extinct members of the reptilian class is such as to rank
them amongst the most extraordinary of all the creatures yet discovered
in the ruins of the ancient earth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>Remains of the Pterodactyle were first discovered, in 1784, by
Prof. Collini, in the lithographic slate of Aichstadt, in Germany,
which slate is a member of the oolitic formations: the species so discovered
was at first mistaken for a bird, and afterwards supposed
to be a large kind of bat, but had its true reptilian nature demonstrated
by Baron Cuvier, by whom it was called the <i>Pterodactylus
longirostris</i>, or Long-beaked Pterodactyle: it was about the size of a
curlew.</p>
<p>A somewhat larger species&mdash;the <i>Pterodactylus macronyx</i>, or
Long-clawed Pterodactyle&mdash;was subsequently discovered by the
Rev. Dr. Buckland, in the lias formation of Lyme Regis: its
wings, when expanded, must have been about four feet from tip to
tip. The smallest known species&mdash;the <i>Pterodactylus brevirostris</i>, or
Short-beaked Pterodactyle&mdash;was discovered in the lithographic slate
at Solenhofen, Germany, and has been described by Professor
Soemmering.</p>
<p>Remains of the largest known kinds of Pterodactyle have been
discovered more recently in chalk-pits, at Burham, in Kent. The
skull of one of these species&mdash;the <i>Pterodactylus Cuvieri</i>&mdash;was about
twenty inches in length, and the animal was upborne on an expanse
of wing of probably not less than eighteen feet from tip to
tip. The restored specimen of this species is numbered 3.</p>
<p>A second very large kind of Pterodactyle&mdash;the <i>Pterodactylus
compressirostris</i>, or Thin-beaked Pterodactyle&mdash;had a head from
fourteen to sixteen inches in length, and an expanse of wing, from
tip to tip, of fifteen feet. The remains of this species have also
been found in the chalk of Kent. From the same formation and
locality a third large kind of Pterodactyle, although inferior in
size to the two foregoing, has been discovered, called the <i>Pterodactylus
conirostris</i>, and also&mdash;until the foregoing larger kinds were
discovered&mdash;<i>Pterodactylus giganteus</i>. The long, sharp, conical teeth
in the jaws of the Pterodactyles indicate them to have preyed upon
other living animals; their eyes were large, as if to enable them to
fly by night. From their wings projected fingers, terminated by
long curved claws, and forming a powerful paw, wherewith the
animal was enabled to creep and climb, or suspend itself from trees.
It is probable, also, that the Pterodactyles had the power of swimming;
some kinds, <i>e.g.</i>, the <i>Pterodactylus Gemmingi</i>, had a long
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
and stiff tail. &ldquo;Thus,&rdquo; writes Dr. Buckland, &ldquo;like Milton&rsquo;s
Fiend, all qualified for all services and all elements, the creature
was a fit companion for the kindred reptiles that swarmed in the
seas, or crawled on the shores of a turbulent planet.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t10">&lsquo;The Fiend,</p>
<p class="t0">O&rsquo;er bog, or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare,</p>
<p class="t0">With head, hands, wings, or feet, pursues his way,</p>
<p class="t0">And swims, or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flies.&rsquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small"><span class="ss">THE WEALDEN.</span></span></h2>
<p>The Wealden is a mass of petrified clay, sand, and sandstone,
deposited from the fresh or brackish water of probably some
great estuary, and extending over parts of the counties of Kent,
Surrey, and Sussex. This fresh-water formation derives its name
from the &ldquo;Weald&rdquo; or &ldquo;Wold&rdquo; of Kent, where it was first geologically
studied, and where it is exposed by the removal of the
chalk, which covers or overlies it, in other parts of the South of
England.</p>
<p>The Wealden is divided into three groups of strata, which succeed
each other in the following descending order:&mdash;</p>
<p>1st. Weald Clay, sometimes including thin beds of sand and
shelly limestone, forming beds of from 140 to 280 feet in depth or
vertical thickness.</p>
<p>2nd. Hastings Sand, in which occur some clays and calcareous
grits, forming beds of from 400 to 500 feet in depth.</p>
<p>3rd. Purbeck Beds, so called from being exposed chiefly in the
Isle of Purbeck, off the coast of Dorsetshire, where it forms the
quarries of the limestone for which Purbeck is famous: the beds
of limestones and marls are from 150 to 200 feet in depth.</p>
<h3 id="c7">Nos. 4 &amp; 5.&mdash;<span class="sc">The Iguanodon.</span>
<br />(<i>Iguanodon Mantelli</i>, Conybeare.)</h3>
<p>One afternoon, in the spring of 1822, an accomplished lady, the
wife of a medical practitioner, at Lewes, in Sussex, walking along
the picturesque paths of Tilgate Forest, discovered some objects in
the coarse conglomerate rock of the quarries of that locality, which,
from their peculiar form and substance, she thought would be
interesting to her husband, whose attention had been directed,
during his professional drives, to the geology and fossils of his
neighbourhood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>The lady was Mrs. Mantell: her husband, the subsequently
distinguished geologist, Dr. Mantell,<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> perceived that the fossils
discovered by his wife were teeth, and teeth of a large and
unknown animal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As these teeth,&rdquo; writes the doctor, &ldquo;were distinct from any
that had previously come under my notice, I felt anxious to submit
them to the examination of persons whose knowledge and
means of observation were more extensive than my own. I
therefore transmitted specimens to some of the most eminent
naturalists in this country and on the continent. But although
my communications were acknowledged with that candour and
liberality which constantly characterise the intercourse of scientific
men, yet no light was thrown upon the subject, except by
the illustrious Baron Cuvier, whose opinions will best appear by
the following extract from the correspondence with which he
honoured me:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;These teeth are certainly unknown to me; they are not from
a carnivorous animal, and yet I believe that they belong, from
their slight degree of complexity, the notching of their margins,
and the thin coat of enamel that covers them, to the order of
reptiles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;May we not here have a new animal!&mdash;a herbivorous reptile?
And, just as at the present time with regard to mammals (land-quadrupeds
with warm blood), it is amongst the herbivorous that
we find the largest species, so also with the reptiles at the remote
period when they were the sole terrestrial animals, might not the
largest amongst them have been nourished by vegetables?</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Some of the great bones which you possess may belong to
this animal, which, up to the present time, is unique in its kind.
Time will confirm or confute this idea, since it is impossible but
that one day a part of the skeleton, united to portions of jaws
with the teeth, will be discovered.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These remarks,&rdquo; Dr. Mantell proceeds to say, &ldquo;induced me to
pursue my investigations with increased assiduity, but hitherto they
have not been attended with the desired success, no connected
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
portion of the skeleton having been discovered. Among the specimens
lately connected, some, however, were so perfect, that I
resolved to avail myself of the obliging offer of Mr. Clift (to whose
kindness and liberality I hold myself particularly indebted), to
assist me in comparing the fossil teeth with those of the recent
Lacert&aelig; in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons. The
result of this examination proved highly satisfactory, for in an
Iguana which Mr. Stutchbury had prepared to present to the
College, we discovered teeth possessing the form and structure of
the fossil specimens.&rdquo; (Phil. Trans., 1825, p. 180.) And he
afterwards adds:&mdash;&ldquo;The name Iguanodon, derived from the form
of the teeth, (and which I have adopted at the suggestion of the
Rev. W. Conybeare,) will not, it is presumed, be deemed objectionable.&rdquo;
(Ib. p. 184.)</p>
<p>The further discovery which Baron Cuvier&rsquo;s prophetic glance
saw buried in the womb of time, and the birth of which verified
his conjecture that some of the great bones collected by Dr. Mantell
belonged to the same animal as the teeth, was made by Mr. W. H.
Bensted, of Maidstone, the proprietor of a stone-quarry of the
Shanklin-sand formation, in the close vicinity of that town. This
gentleman had his attention one day, in May, 1834, called by his
workmen to what they supposed to be petrified wood in some pieces
of stone which they had been blasting. He perceived that what
they supposed to be wood was fossil bone, and with a zeal and
care which have always characterised his endeavours to secure for
science any evidence of fossil remains in his quarry, he immediately
resorted to the spot. He found that the bore or blast by which these
remains were brought to light, had been inserted into the centre of
the specimen, so that the mass of stone containing it had been shattered
into many pieces, some of which were blown into the adjoining
fields. All these pieces he had carefully collected, and proceeding
with equal ardour and success to the removal of the matrix from
the fossils, he succeeded after a month&rsquo;s labour in exposing them
to view, and in fitting the fragments to their proper places.</p>
<p>This specimen is now in the British Museum.</p>
<p>Many other specimens of detached bones, including vertebr&aelig; or
parts of the back-bone, especially that part resting on the hind
limbs, and called the &ldquo;pelvis,&rdquo; bones of the limbs, down to those
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
that supported the claws, together with jaws and teeth, which have
since been successively discovered, have enabled anatomists to reconstruct
the extinct Iguanodon, and have proved it to have been a
herbivorous reptile, of colossal dimensions, analogous to the diminutive
Iguana in the form of its teeth, but belonging to a distinct and
higher order of reptiles, more akin to the crocodiles. The same
rich materials, selecting the largest of the bones as a standard, have
served for the present restorations (Nos. 4 and 5) of the animal, as
when alive: all the parts being kept in just proportion to the
standard bones, and the whole being thus brought to the following
dimensions:&mdash;</p>
<table class="center" summary="">
<tr><td class="l">Total length, from the nose or muzzle to the end of the tail </td><td class="r">34 </td><td class="c">feet </td><td class="r">9 </td><td class="c">inches.</td></tr>

</table>
<p>The character of the scales is conjectural, and the horn more
than doubtful, though attributed to the Iguanodon by Dr. Mantell
and most geologists.</p>
<p>This animal probably lived near estuaries and rivers, and may
have derived its food from the <i>Clathrari&aelig;</i>, <i>Zami&aelig;</i>, <i>Cycades</i>, and
other extinct trees, of which the fossil remains abound in the same
formations as those yielding the bones and teeth of the Iguanodon.</p>
<p>These formations are the Wealden and the Neocomian or green-sand:
the localities in which the remains of the Iguanodon have been
principally found, are the Weald of Kent and Sussex: Horsham,
in Sussex; Maidstone, in Kent; and the Isle of Wight.</p>
<p>Restorations of the <i>Cycas</i> and <i>Zamia</i> are placed, with the
Iguanodon, on the Wealden division of the Secondary Island.</p>
<h3 id="c8">No. 6.&mdash;<span class="sc">The Hyl&aelig;osaurus.</span> (<i>Hyl&aelig;osaurus Owenii.</i>)</h3>
<p>The animal, so called by its discoverer, Dr. Mantell, belongs to
the same highly organised order of the class of reptiles as the
Iguanodon, that, viz., which was characterised by a longer and
stronger sacrum and pelvis, and by larger limbs than the reptiles of
the present day possess; they were accordingly better fitted for
progression on dry land, and probably carried their body higher and
more freely above the surface of the ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>Visiting, in the summer of 1832, a quarry in Tilgate Forest,
Dr. Mantell had his attention attracted to some fragments of a large
mass of stone, which had recently been broken up, and which exhibited
traces of numerous pieces of bone. The portions of the rock,
which admitted of being restored together, were cemented, and
then the rock was chiselled from the fossil bones, which consisted
of part of the back-bone or vertebral column, some ribs, the
shoulder bones called scapula and coracoid, and numerous long
angular bones or spines which seemed to have supported a lofty
serrated or jagged crest, extended along the middle of the back, as
in some of the small existing lizards, <i>e.g.</i>, the Iguana: cut No. 6.
Many small dermal bones were also found, which indicate the
Hyl&aelig;osaurus to have been covered by hard tuberculate scales, like
those of some of the Australian lizards, called <i>Cyclodus</i>.</p>
<p>This character of the skin, and the serrated crest, are accurately
given in the restoration, the major part of which, however, is
necessarily at present conjectural, and carried out according to the
general analogies of the saurian form. The size is indicated with
more certainty according to the proportions of the known vertebr&aelig;
and other bones.</p>

<h2 id="c9"><span class="small"><span class="ss">THE OOLITE.</span></span></h2>
<p>The division of the secondary formations, called &ldquo;Oolite,&rdquo; takes
its name from the most characteristic of its constituents, which is a
variety of limestone composed of numerous small grains, resembling
the &ldquo;roe&rdquo; or eggs of a fish, whence the term, (from the Greek <i>oon</i>,
an egg, <i>lithos</i>, a stone). The oolite, however, includes a great series
of beds of marine origin, which, with an average breadth of thirty
miles, extend across England, from Yorkshire in the north-east to
Dorsetshire in the south-west.</p>
<p>The oolite series lies below the Wealden, and where this is
wanting, below the chalk, and consists of the following subdivisions,
succeeding each other in the descending order:&mdash;</p>

<p>Upon the portion of the island representing the oolite series, the
most conspicuous of the restored animals of that period is&mdash;</p>
<h3 id="c10">No. 7.&mdash;<span class="sc">The Megalosaurus.</span></h3>
<p>The Megalosaurus, as its name implies (compounded by its discoverer,
Dr. Buckland, from the Greek <i>megas</i>, great, and <i>sauros</i>,
lizard), was a lizard-like reptile of great size, &ldquo;of which,&rdquo; writes Dr.
Buckland, &ldquo;although no skeleton has yet been found entire, so
many perfect bones and teeth have been discovered in the same
quarries, that we are nearly as well acquainted with the form and
dimensions of the limbs as if they had been found together in a single
block of stone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>The restoration of the animal has been accordingly effected,
agreeably with the proportions of the known parts of the skeleton,
and in harmony with the general characters of the order of
reptiles to which the Megalosaurus belonged. This order&mdash;the
Dinosauria (Gr. <i>deinos</i>, terribly great <i>sauros</i>, a lizard)&mdash;is that
to which the two foregoing huge reptiles of the Wealden series
belong, viz., the Iguanodon and Hyl&aelig;osaurus, and is characterised
by the modifications already mentioned, that fitted them for more
efficient progression upon dry land. The Iguanodon represented
the herbivorous section of the order, the Hyl&aelig;osaurus appears, from
its teeth, to have been a mixed feeder, but the Megalosaurus was
decidedly carnivorous, and, probably, waged a deadly war against
its less destructively endowed congeners and contemporaries.</p>

<p class="pcap">No. 7. Megalosaurus.</p>
</div>
<p>Baron Cuvier estimated the Megalosaurus to have been about
fifty feet in length; my own calculations, founded on more complete
evidence than had been at the Baron&rsquo;s command, reduce its
size to about thirty-five feet:<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> but with the superior proportional
height and capacity of trunk, as contrasted with the largest existing
crocodiles, even that length gives a most formidable character to
this extinct predatory reptile.</p>
<p>As the thigh-bone (<i>femur</i>) and leg-bone (<i>tibia</i>) measure each
nearly three feet, the entire hind-leg, allowing for the cartilages of
the joints, must have attained a length of two yards: a bone of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
foot (metatarsal) thirteen inches long, indicates that part, with the
toes and claws entire, to have been at least three feet in length.
The form of the teeth shows the Megalosaurus to have been strictly
carnivorous, and viewed as instruments for providing food for
so enormous a reptile, the teeth were fearfully fitted to the
destructive office for which they were designed. They have compressed
conical sharp-pointed crowns, with cutting and finely
serrated anterior and posterior edges; they appear straight, as
seen when they had just protruded from the socket, but become
bent slightly backwards in the progress of growth, and the
fore part of the crown, below the summit, becomes thick and
convex.</p>
<p>A minute and interesting description of these teeth will be found
in Dr. Buckland&rsquo;s admirable &ldquo;Bridgewater Treatise&rdquo; (vol. i.
p. 238), from which he concludes that the teeth of the Megalosaurus
present &ldquo;a combination of contrivances analogous to those which
human ingenuity has adopted in the construction of the knife, the
sabre, and the saw.&rdquo; The fossils which brought to light the former
existence of this most formidable reptile, were discovered in 1823,
in the oolitic slate of Stonesfield, near Oxford, and were described
by Dr. Buckland, in the volume of the &ldquo;Geological Transactions&rdquo;
for the year 1824.</p>
<p>Remains of the Megalosaurus have since been discovered in the
&ldquo;Bath oolite,&rdquo; which is immediately below the Stonesfield slate,
and in the &ldquo;Cornbrash,&rdquo; which lies above it. Vertebr&aelig;, teeth,
and some bones of the extremities have been discovered in the
Wealden of Tilgate Forest, Kent, and in the ferruginous sand,
of the same age, near Cuckfield, in Sussex. Remains of the
Megalosaurus also occur in the Purbeck limestone at Swanage Bay,
and in the oolite in the neighbourhood of Malton, in Yorkshire.</p>
<p>Mr. Waterhouse Hawkins&rsquo;s restoration, according to the proportions
calculated from the largest portions of fossil bones of the
Megalosaurus hitherto obtained, yields a total length of the animal,
from the muzzle to the end of the tail, of thirty-seven feet; the
length of the head being five feet, the length of the tail fifteen feet;
and the greatest girth of the body twenty-two feet six inches.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<h3 id="c11">Nos. 8 &amp; 9.&mdash;<span class="sc">Pterodactyles of the Oolite.</span></h3>
<p>To the right of the Hyl&aelig;osaurus, on the rock representing the
greater oolite formation, are restorations of species of Pterodactyle
(<i>Pterodactylus Bucklandi</i>, No. 9), smaller than and distinct from those
of the chalk formations. The remains of Buckland&rsquo;s Pterodactyle are
found pretty abundantly in the oolitic slate of Stonesfield, near
Oxford.</p>
<h3 id="c12">Nos. 10 &amp; 11.&mdash;<span class="sc">Teleosaurus.</span></h3>
<p>On the shore beneath the overhanging cliff of oolitic rock are two
restorations, Nos. 10 and 11, of a large extinct kind of crocodile,
to which the long and slender-jawed crocodile of the Ganges, called
&ldquo;Gavi&agrave;l&rdquo; or &ldquo;Gharri&agrave;l&rdquo; by the Hindoos, offers the nearest resemblance
at the present day. Remains of the ancient extinct British
gavials have been found in most of the localities where the oolitic formations
occur, and very abundantly in the lias cliffs near Whitby, in
Yorkshire. The name Teleosaurus (<i>telos</i>, the end, <i>sauros</i>, a lizard),
was compounded from the Greek by Professor Geoffroy St. Hilaire,
for a species of these fossil gavials, found by him in the oolite stone
at Caen, in Normandy, and has reference to his belief that they
formed one&mdash;the earliest&mdash;extreme of the crocodilian series, as this
series has been successively developed in the course of time on our
planet.</p>
<p>The jaws are armed with numerous long, slender, sharp-pointed,
slightly curved teeth, indicating that they preyed on fishes, and the
young or weaker individuals of co-existing reptiles. The nostril
is situated more at the end of the upper jaw than in the modern
gavial: the fore-limbs are shorter, and the hind ones longer and
stronger than in the gavial, which indicates that the Teleosaur was
a better swimmer; the vertebr&aelig; or bones of the back are united by
slightly concave surfaces, not interlocked by cup and ball joints as
in the modern crocodiles, whence it would seem that the Teleosaur
lived more habitually in the water, and less seldom moved on dry
land; and, as its fossil remains have been hitherto found only in
the sedimentary deposits from the sea, it may be inferred that it
was more strictly marine than the crocodile of the Ganges.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>The first specimen of a Teleosaur that was brought to light was
from the &ldquo;alum-schale&rdquo; which forms one layer of the lofty lias
cliffs of the Yorkshire coast, near Whitby. A brief description,
and figures, of this incomplete fossil skeleton were published by
Messrs. Wooller and Chapman, in separate communications, in
the 50th volume of the &ldquo;Philosophical Transactions,&rdquo; in 1758.
Captain Chapman observes, &ldquo;it seems to have been an alligator;&rdquo;
and Mr. Wooller thought &ldquo;it resembled in every respect the
Gangetic gavial.&rdquo; Thus, nearly a century ago, the true nature of
the fossil was almost rightly understood, and various were the
theories then broached to account for the occurrence of a supposed
Gangetic reptile in a petrified state in the cliffs of Yorkshire. It
has required the subsequent progress of comparative anatomy to
determine, as by the characters above defined, the essential distinction
of the Teleosaur from all known existing forms of crocodilian
reptiles.</p>
<p>Very abundant remains, and several species, of the extinct genus
have been subsequently discovered: but always in the oolitic and
liassic formations of the secondary series of rocks.</p>
<p>The oolitic group of rocks are very rich in remains of both
plants and animals: many reptiles of genera and species distinct
from those here restored have been recognised and determined by
portions of the skeleton. Extremely numerous are the remains of
fishes, chiefly of an almost extinct order (<i>Ganoidei</i>), characterised
by hard, shining, enamelled scales. But the most remarkable
fossils are those which indisputably prove the existence, during the
period of the &ldquo;Great&rdquo; or &ldquo;Lower Oolite,&rdquo; of insectivorous and
marsupial mammalia&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, of warm-blood quadrupeds, which,
like the shrew or hedgehog, fed on insects, and, like the opossum,
had a pouch for the transport of the young. The lower jaw of
one of these earliest known examples of the mammalian class,
found in the Stonesfield slate, near Oxford, may be seen at the
British Museum, to which it was presented by J. W. Broderip,
Esq., F.R.S., by whom it was described in the &ldquo;Zoological
Journal,&rdquo; vol. iii., p. 408.</p>
<p>It is interesting to observe that the marsupial genera, to which
the above fossil quadruped, called <i>Phascolotherium</i>, was most
nearly allied, are now confined to New South Wales and Van
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
Diemen&rsquo;s Land; since it is in the Australian seas that is found
the <i>Cestracion</i>, a cartilaginous fish which has teeth that are most
like those fossil teeth called <i>Acrodus</i> and <i>Psammodus</i>, so common
in the oolite. In the same Australian seas, also, near the shore,
the beautiful shell-fish called <i>Trigonia</i> is found living, of which
genus many fossil species occur in the Stonesfield slate. Moreover,
the Araucarian pines are now abundant, together with ferns,
in Australia, as they were in Europe in the oolitic period.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small"><span class="ss">THE LIAS.</span></span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Lias&rdquo; is an English provincial name adopted in geology, and
applied to a formation of limestone, marl, and petrified clay, which
forms the base of the oolite, or immediately underlies that division
of secondary rocks. The lias has been traced throughout a great
part of Europe, forming beds of a thickness varying from 500 to
1000 feet of the above-mentioned substances, which have been
gradually deposited from a sea of corresponding extent and
direction. The lias abounds with marine shells of extinct species,
and with remains of fishes that were clad with large and hard
shining scales. Of the higher or air-breathing animals of that
period, the most characteristic were the</p>
<h3 id="c14"><span class="sc">Enaliosauria.</span></h3>
<p>The creatures called Enaliosauria or Sea-lizards (from the Greek
<i>enalios</i>, of the sea, and <i>sauros</i>, lizard), were vertebrate animals, or
had back bones, breathed the air like land quadrupeds, but were
cold-blooded, or of a low temperature, like crocodiles and other
reptiles. The proof that the Enaliosaurs respired atmospheric air
immediately, and did not breathe water by means of gills like fishes,
is afforded by the absence of the bony framework of the gill
apparatus, and by the presence, position, and structure of the air
passages leading from the nostrils, and also by the bony mechanism
of the capacious chest or thoracic-abdominal cavity: all of which
characters have been demonstrated by their fossil skeletons. With
these characters the Sea-lizards combined the presence of two pairs
of limbs shaped like fins, and adapted for swimming.</p>
<p>The Enaliosauria offer two principal modifications of their
anatomical, and especially their bony, structure, of which the two
kinds grouped together under the respective names of Ichthyosaurus
and Plesiosaurus are the examples.</p>
<h3 id="c15"><span class="sc">The Ichthyosaurus.</span></h3>
<p>The genus Ichthyosaurus includes many species: of which three
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
of the best known and most remarkable have been selected for
restoration to illustrate this most singular of the extinct forms of
animal life.</p>
<p>The name (from the Greek <i>ichthys</i>, a fish, and <i>sauros</i>, a lizard)
indicates the closer affinity of the Ichthyosaur, as compared with
the Plesiosaur, to the class of fishes. The Ichthyosaurs are remarkable
for the shortness of the neck and the equality of the width of
the back of the head with the front of the chest, impressing the
observer of the fossil skeleton with a conviction that the ancient
animal must have resembled the whale tribe and the fishes in the
absence of any intervening constriction or &ldquo;neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This close approximation in the Ichthyosaurs to the form of the
most strictly aquatic back-boned (vertebrate) animals of the existing
creation is accompanied by an important modification of the surfaces
forming the joints of the back-bone, each of which surfaces
is hollow, leading to the inference that they were originally connected
together by an elastic bag, or &ldquo;capsule,&rdquo; filled with fluid&mdash;a
structure which prevails in the class of fishes, but not in any of
the whale or porpoise tribe, nor in any, save a few of the very
lowest and most fish-like, of the existing reptiles.</p>
<p>With the above modifications of the head, trunk, and limbs, in
relation to swimming, there co-exist corresponding modifications of
the tail. The bones of this part are much more numerous than in
the Plesiosaurs, and the entire tail is consequently longer; but it
does not show any of those modifications that characterise the bony
support of the tail in fishes. The numerous &ldquo;caudal vertebr&aelig;&rdquo;
of the Ichthyosaurus gradually decrease in size to the end of the
tail, where they assume a compressed form, or are flattened from
side to side, and thus the tail instead of being short and broad, as
in fishes, is lengthened out as in crocodiles.</p>
<p>The very frequent occurrence of a fracture of the tail, about
one fourth of the way from its extremity, in well-preserved
and entire fossil skeletons, is owing to that proportion of the
end of the tail having supported a tail-fin. The only evidence
which the fossil skeleton of a whale would yield of the
powerful horizontal tail-fin characteristic of the living animal, is
the depressed or horizontally flattened form of the bones supporting
such fin. It is inferred, therefore, from the corresponding bones
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
of the Ichthyosaurus being flattened from side to side, that it
possessed a tegumentary tail-fin expanded in the vertical direction.
The shape of a fin composed of such perishable material is of
course conjectural, but from analogies, not necessary here to
further enlarge upon, it was probably like, or nearly like, that
which the able artist engaged in the restoration of the entire form
of the animal has given to it. Thus, in the construction of the
principal swimming-organ of the Ichthyosaurus we may trace, as
in other parts of its structure, a combination of mammalian
(beast-like), saurian (lizard-like), and piscine (fish-like) peculiarities.
In its great length and gradual diminution we perceive its saurian
character; the tegumentary nature of the fin, unsustained by bony
fin-rays, bespeaks its affinity to the same part in the mammalian
whales and porpoises; whilst its vertical position makes it closely
resemble the tail-fin of the fish.</p>
<p>The horizontality of the tail-fin of the whale tribe is essentially
connected with their necessities as warm-blooded animals breathing
atmospheric air; without this means of displacing a mass of
water in the vertical direction, the head of the whale could not be
brought with the required rapidity to the surface to respire; but
the Ichthyosaurs, not being warm-blooded, or quick breathers,
would not need to bring their head to the surface so frequently, or
so rapidly, as the whale; and, moreover, a compensation for the
want of horizontality of their tail-fin was provided by the addition
of a pair of hind-paddles, which are not present in the whale
tribe. The vertical fin was a more efficient organ in the rapid
cleaving of the liquid element, when the Ichthyosaurs were in
pursuit of their prey, or escaping from an enemy.</p>
<p>That the Ichthyosaurs occasionally sought the shores, crawled
on the strand, and basked in the sunshine, may be inferred from
the bony structure connected with their fore-fins, which does not
exist in any porpoise, dolphin, grampus, or whale; and for want of
which, chiefly, those warm-blooded, air-breathing, marine animals are
so helpless when left high and dry on the sands: the structure in question
in the Ichthyosaur is a strong osseous arch, inverted and spanning
across beneath the chest from one shoulder-joint to the other;
and what is most remarkable in the structure of this &ldquo;scapular&rdquo;
arch, as it is called, is, that it closely resembles, in the number,
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
shape, and disposition of its bones, the same part in the singular
aquatic mammalian quadruped of Australia, called <i>Ornithorhynchus</i>,
<i>Platypus</i>, and Duck-mole. The Ichthyosaurs, when so visiting the
shore, either for sleep, or procreation, would lie, or crawl prostrate,
or with the belly resting or dragging on the ground.</p>
<p>The most extraordinary feature of the head was the enormous
magnitude of the eye; and from the quantity of light
admitted by the expanded pupil it must have possessed great
powers of vision, especially in the dusk. It is not uncommon to
find in front of the orbit (cavity for the eye), in fossil skulls, a
circular series of petrified thin bony plates, ranged round a central
aperture, where the pupil of the eye was placed. The eyes of
many fishes are defended by a bony covering consisting of two
pieces; but a compound circle of overlapping plates is now found
only in the eyes of turtles, tortoises, lizards, and birds. This
curious apparatus of bony plates would aid in protecting the eyeball
from the waves of the sea when the Ichthyosaurus rose to the
surface, and from the pressure of the dense element when it dived
to great depths; and they show, writes Dr. Buckland,<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a> &ldquo;that
the enormous eye, of which they formed the front, was an optical
instrument of varied and prodigious power, enabling the Ichthyosaurus
to descry its prey at great or little distances, in the
obscurity of night, and in the depths of the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of no extinct reptile are the materials for a complete and
exact restoration more abundant and satisfactory than of the Ichthyosaurus;
they plainly show that its general external figure must
have been that of a huge predatory abdominal fish, with a longer
tail, and a smaller tail-fin: scale-less, moreover, and covered by
a smooth, or finely wrinkled skin analogous to that of the
whale tribe.</p>
<p>The mouth was wide, and the jaws long, and armed with
numerous pointed teeth, indicative of a predatory and carnivorous
nature in all the species; but these differed from one another in
regard to the relative strength of the jaws, and the relative size
and length of the teeth.</p>
<p>Masses of masticated bones and scales of extinct fishes, that
lived in the same seas and at the same period as the Ichthyosaurus,
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
have been found under the ribs of fossil specimens, in the
situation where the stomach of the animal was placed; smaller,
harder, and more digested masses, containing also fish-bones and
scales have been found, bearing the impression of the structure of
the internal surface of the intestine of the great predatory sea-lizard.
These digested masses are called &ldquo;coprolites.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In tracing the evidences of creative power from the earlier to the
later formations of the earth&rsquo;s crust, remains of the Ichthyosaurus
are first found in the lower lias, and occur, more or less abundantly,
through all the superincumbent secondary strata up to, and inclusive
of, the chalk formations. They are most numerous in the lias and
oolite, and the largest and most characteristic species have been
found in these formations.</p>
<h3 id="c16">No. 12.&mdash;<span class="sc">Ichthyosaurus platyodon.</span></h3>
<p>This most gigantic species, so called on account of the crown of
the tooth being more flattened than in other species, and having
sharp edges, as well as a sharp point, was first discovered in the
lias of Lyme Regis, in Dorsetshire. Fossil remains now in the
British Museum, and in the museum of the Geological Society,
fully bear out the dimensions exhibited by the restoration of the
animal as seen basking on the shore between the two specimens of
Long-necked Plesiosaurs. The head of this species is relatively
larger in proportion to the trunk, than in the <i>Ichthyosaurus communis</i>
or <i>Ichthyosaurus tenuirostris</i>: the lower jaw is remarkably massive
and powerful, and projects backwards beyond the joint, as far as
it does in the crocodile. In the skull of an individual of this species,
preserved in the apartments of the Geological Society of London, the
cavity for the eye, or orbit, measures, in its long diameter, fourteen
inches. The fore and hind paddles are large and of equal size.</p>
<p>The lias of the valley of Lyme Regis, Dorsetshire, is the chief
grave-yard of the <i>Ichthyosaurus platyodon</i>; but its remains are
pretty widely distributed. They have been found in the lias of
Glastonbury, of Bristol, of Scarborough and Whitby, and of Bitton,
in Gloucestershire; some vertebr&aelig;, apparently of this species,
have likewise been found in the lias at Ohmden, in Germany.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<h3 id="c17">No. 13.&mdash;<span class="sc">Ichthyosaurus tenuirostris.</span></h3>
<p>Behind the <i>Ichthyosaurus platyodon</i>, is placed the restoration of
the <i>Ichthyosaurus tenuirostris</i>, or Slender-snouted Fish-lizard. The
most striking peculiarity of this species is the great length and
slenderness of the jaw-bones, which, in combination with the large
eye-sockets and flattened cranium, give to the entire skull a form
which resembles that of a gigantic snipe or woodcock, with the bill
armed with teeth. These weapons, in the present species, are
relatively more numerous, smaller, and more sharply pointed than in
the foregoing, and indicate that the <i>Ichthyosaurus tenuirostris</i> preyed
on a smaller kind of fish. The fore-paddles are larger than the hind
ones. In the museum of the Philosophical Institution, at Bristol,
there is an almost entire skeleton of the present species which
measures thirteen feet in length. It was discovered in the lias
of Lyme Regis. Portions of jaws and other parts of the
skeletons of larger individuals have been found fossil in the
lias near Bristol, at Barrow-on-Soar, in Leicestershire, and at
Stratford-on-Avon. The <i>Ichthyosaurus tenuirostris</i> has also left its
remains in the lias formation at Boll and Amburg, in Wirtemberg,
Germany.</p>
<h3 id="c18">No. 14.&mdash;<span class="sc">Ichthyosaurus communis.</span></h3>
<p>Of this species, which was the most &ldquo;common,&rdquo; when first discovered
in 1824, but which has since been surpassed by other
species in regard to the known number of individuals, the head is
restored, as protruded from the water, to the right of the foregoing
species.</p>
<p>The <i>Ichthyosaurus communis</i> is characterised by its relatively
large teeth, with expanded, deeply-grooved bases, and round conical
furrowed crowns; the upper jaw contains, on each side, from forty
to fifty of such teeth. The fore-paddles are three times larger than
the hind ones. With respect to the size which it attained, the
<i>Ichthyosaurus communis</i> seems only to be second to the <i>Ichthyosaurus
platyodon</i>. In the museum of the Earl of Enniskillen, there is a
fossil skull of the <i>Ichthyosaurus communis</i> which measures, in length,
two feet nine inches, indicating an animal of at least twenty feet
in length.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<h3 id="c19"><span class="sc">Plesiosaurus.</span></h3>
<p>The discovery of this genus forms one of the most important
additions that geology has made to comparative anatomy. Baron
Cuvier deemed &ldquo;its structure to have been the most singular, and
its characters the most monstrous, that had been yet discovered amid
the ruins of a former world.&rdquo; To the head of a lizard it united
the teeth of a crocodile, a neck of enormous length, resembling the
body of a serpent, a trunk and tail having the proportions of an
ordinary quadruped, the ribs of a chameleon, and the paddles of a
whale. &ldquo;Such,&rdquo; writes Dr. Buckland, &ldquo;are the strange combinations
of form and structure in the Plesiosaurus, a genus, the
remains of which, after interment for thousands of years amidst
the wreck of millions of extinct inhabitants of the ancient earth,
are at length recalled to light by the researches of the geologist,
and submitted to our examination, in nearly as perfect a state as
the bones of species that are now existing upon the earth.&rdquo; (Op.
cit., vol. v. p. 203).</p>
<p>The first remains of this animal were discovered in the lias of
Lyme Regis, about the year 1823, and formed the subject of the
paper by the Rev. Mr. Conybeare (now Dean of Llandaff), and
Mr. (now Sir Henry) De la Beche, in which the genus was
established and named Plesiosaurus (from the Greek words, <i>plesios</i>
and <i>sauros</i>, signifying &ldquo;near&rdquo; or &ldquo;allied to,&rdquo; and &ldquo;lizard&rdquo;),
because the authors saw that it was more nearly allied to the lizard
than was the Ichthyosaurus from the same formation.</p>
<p>The entire and undisturbed skeletons of several individuals, of
different species, have since been discovered, fully confirming the
sagacious restorations by the original discoverers of the <i>Plesiosaurus</i>.
Of these species three have been selected as the subjects of Mr.
Waterhouse Hawkins&rsquo;s reconstructions and representations of the
living form of the strange reptiles.</p>
<h3 id="c20">No. 15.&mdash;<span class="sc">Plesiosaurus macrocephalus.</span></h3>
<p>The first of these has been called, from the relatively larger size
of the head, the <i>Plesiosaurus macrocephalus</i> (No. 15), (Gr. <i>macros</i>,
long, <i>cephale</i>, head). The entire length of the animal, as indicated
by the largest remains, and as given in the restoration, is eighteen
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
feet, the length of the head being two feet, that of the neck six
feet; the greatest girth of the body yields seven feet.</p>

<p class="pcap">No. 15. Plesiosaurus macrocephalus.</p>
</div>
<p>Although Baron Cuvier and Dr. Buckland both rightly allude
to the resemblance of the fins or paddles of the Plesiosaur to
those of the whale, yet this most remarkable difference must be
borne in mind, that, whereas the whale tribe have never more than
one pair of fins, the Plesiosaurs have always two pairs, answering
to the fore and hind limbs of land quadrupeds; and the fore-pair
of fins, corresponding to those in the whale, differed by being more
firmly articulated, through the medium of collar-bones (clavicles),
and of two other very broad and strong bones (called coracoids),
to the trunk (thorax), whereby they were the better enabled to
move the animal upon dry land.</p>
<p>Remains of the <i>Plesiosaurus macrocephalus</i> have been discovered
in the lias of Lyme Regis, in Dorsetshire, and of Weston, in
Somersetshire.</p>
<h3 id="c21">No. 16.&mdash;<span class="sc">Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus.</span></h3>
<p>Further to the left, on the shore of the Secondary Island, is a
restoration of the <i>Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus</i>, or Long-necked Plesiosaurus
(No. 16). The head in this remarkable species is smaller, and

the neck proportionally longer than in the <i>Plesiosaurus macrocephalus</i>.
The remains of the Long-necked Plesiosaur have been found chiefly
at Lyme Regis, in Dorsetshire. The well known specimen of an
almost entire skeleton, formerly in the possession of His Grace the
Duke of Buckingham, is now in the British Museum.</p>
<h3 id="c22">No. 17.&mdash;<span class="sc">Plesiosaurus Hawkinsii.</span></h3>
<p>The most perfect skeletons of the Plesiosaurus are those that
have been wrought out of the lias at Street, near Glastonbury, by
Mr. Thomas Hawkins, F.G.S., and which have been purchased by
the trustees of the British Museum. A restoration is given by
Mr. Waterhouse Hawkins, at No. 17, of a species with characters
somewhat intermediate between the Large-headed and Long-necked
Plesiosaurs, and which has been called, after its discoverer, <i>Plesiosaurus
Hawkinsii</i>.</p>
<p>The Plesiosaurs breathed air like the existing crocodiles and the
whale tribe, and appear to have lived in shallow seas and estuaries.
That the Long-necked Sea-lizard was aquatic is evident from the
form of its paddles; and that it was marine is almost equally so,
from the remains with which its fossils are universally associated;
that it may have occasionally visited the shore, the resemblance of
its extremities to those of a turtle leads us to conjecture; its
motion, however, must have been very awkward on land; its long
neck must have impeded its progress through the water, presenting
a striking contrast to the organisation which so admirably adapted
the Ichthyosaurus to cut its swift course through the waves. &ldquo;May
it not, therefore, be concluded that it swam upon, or near the
surface,&rdquo; asks its accomplished discoverer, &ldquo;arching back its long
neck like a swan, and occasionally darting it down at the fish that
happened to float within its reach? It may perhaps have lurked
in shoal-water along the coast, concealed among the sea-weed, and,
raising its nostrils to a level with the surface from a considerable
depth, may have found a secure retreat from the assaults of
dangerous enemies; while the length and flexibility of its neck
may have compensated for the want of strength in its jaws, and
its incapacity for swift motion through the water, by the suddenness
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
and agility of the attack which enabled it to make on every
animal fitted for its prey which came within its reach.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a></p>
<p>For the Secondary Island three species of the Plesiosaurus have
been restored, the <i>Plesiosaurus macrocephalus</i>, the <i>Plesiosaurus
dolichodeirus</i> (Gr. <i>dolichos</i>, long, <i>deire</i>, neck), and the <i>Plesiosaurus
Hawkinsii</i>. The name &ldquo;long-necked&rdquo; was given to the second of
these species before it was known that many other species with
long and slender necks had existed in the seas of the same ancient
period: the third species is named after Mr. Thomas Hawkins,
F.G.S., the gentleman by whose patience, zeal, and skill, the
British Museum has been enriched with so many entire skeletons
of these most extraordinary extinct sea-lizards.</p>
<p>The remains of all these species occur in the lias at Lyme Regis,
and at Street, near Glastonbury; but the <i>Plesiosaurus Hawkinsii</i>
is the most abundant in the latter locality.</p>

<h2 id="c23"><span class="small"><span class="ss">NEW RED SANDSTONE.</span></span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Trias&rdquo; is an arbitrary term applied in geology to the upper
division of a vast series of red loams, shales, and sandstones, interposed
between the lias and the coal, in the midland and western
counties of England. This series is collectively called the &ldquo;New
Red Sandstone formation,&rdquo; to distinguish it from the &ldquo;Old Red
Sandstone formation,&rdquo; of similar or identical mineral character,
which lies immediately beneath the coal.</p>
<p>The animals which have been restored and placed on the lowest
formation of the Secondary Island, are peculiar to the &ldquo;triassic,&rdquo;
or upper division of the &ldquo;New Red Sandstone&rdquo; series, which
division consists, in England, of saliferous (salt-including) shales and
sandstones, from 1000 to 1500 feet thick in Lancashire and
Cheshire, answering to the formation called &ldquo;Keuper-sandstone&rdquo;
by the German geologists; and of sandstone and quartzose conglomerate
of 600 feet in thickness, answering to the German
&ldquo;Bunter-sandstone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The largest and most characteristic animals of the trias are
reptiles of the order</p>
<h3 id="c24"><span class="sc">Batrachia.</span></h3>
<p>The name of this order is from the Greek word <i>batrachos</i>,
signifying a frog: and the order is represented in the present
animal-population of England by a few diminutive species of frogs,
toads, and newts, or water-salamanders. But, at the period of the
deposition of the new red sandstone, in the present counties of
Warwick and Cheshire, the shores of the ancient sea, which were
then formed by that sandy deposit, were trodden by reptiles,
having the essential bony characters of the Batrachia, but combining
these with other bony characters of crocodiles and lizards;
and exhibiting both under a bulk which is made manifest by the
restoration of the largest known species, (No. 16), occupying the
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
extreme promontory of the Island, illustrative of the lowest and
oldest deposits of the secondary series of rocks. The species in
question is called the&mdash;</p>
<h3 id="c25">No. 18.&mdash;<span class="sc">Labyrinthodon Salamandroides.</span></h3>
<p>or the Salamander-like Labyrinthodon; the latter term being from
the Greek, signifying the peculiar structure of the teeth, which
differ from all other reptiles in the huge Batrachia in question, by
reason of the complex labyrinthic interblending of the different
substances composing the teeth. The skull of the Labyrinthodon
is attached to the neck-bones by two joints or condyles, and the
teeth are situated both on the proper jaw-bones, and on the bone
of the roof of the mouth called &ldquo;vomer:&rdquo; both these characters
are only found at the present day in the frogs and salamanders.
The hind-foot of the Labyrinthodon was also, as in the toad and
frog, much larger than the fore-foot; and the innermost digit in
both was short and turned in, like a thumb.</p>

<p class="pcap">No. 18. Labyrinthodon Salamandroides.</p>
</div>
<p>Consecutive impressions of the prints of these feet have been
traced for many steps in succession (as is accurately represented in
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
the new red sandstone part of the Secondary Island) in quarries of
that formation in Warwickshire, Cheshire, and also in Lancashire,
more especially at a quarry of a whitish quartzose sandstone at
Storton Hill, a few miles from Liverpool. The foot-marks are
partly concave and partly in relief; the former are seen upon the
upper surface of the sandstone slabs, but those in relief are only
upon the lower surfaces, being, in fact, natural casts, formed on the
subjacent foot-prints as in moulds. The impressions of the hind-foot
are generally eight inches in length and five inches in width:
near each large footstep, and at a regular distance&mdash;about an inch
and a half&mdash;before it, a smaller print of the fore-foot, four inches
long and three inches wide, occurs. The footsteps follow each
other in pairs, each pair in the same line, at intervals of about
fourteen inches from pair to pair. The large as well as the small
steps show the thumb-like toe alternately on the right and left
side, each step making a print of five toes.</p>
<p>Foot-prints of corresponding form but of smaller size have been
discovered in the quarry at Storton Hill, imprinted on five thin
beds of clay, lying one upon another in the same quarry, and
separated by beds of sandstone. From the lower surface of the
sandstone layers, the solid casts of each impression project in high
relief, and afford models of the feet, toes, and claws of the animals
which trod on the clay.</p>
<p>Similar foot-prints were first observed in Saxony, at the village of
Hessberg, near Hillburghausen, in several quarries of a gray
quartzose sandstone, alternating with beds of red sandstone, and of
the same geological age as the sandstones of England that had
been trodden by the same strange animal. The German geologist,
who first described them, proposed the name of <i>Cheirotherium</i> (Gr.
<i>cheir</i>, the hand, <i>therion</i>, beast), for the great unknown animal that
had left the foot-prints, in consequence of the resemblance, both of
the fore and hind feet, to the impression of a human hand, and
Dr. Kaup conjectured that the animal might be a large species of
the opossum-kind. The discovery, however, of fossil skulls, jaws,
teeth, and a few other bones in the sandstones exhibiting the
footprints in question, has rendered it more probable that both the
footprints and the fossils are evidences of the same kind of huge
extinct Batrachian reptiles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>An entire skull of the largest species discovered in the new red
sandstones of Wurtemberg; a lower jaw of the same species found
in the same formation in Warwickshire; some vertebr&aelig;, and a
few fragments of bones of the limbs, have served, with the indications
of size and shape of the trunk of the animal yielded by the
series of consecutive foot-prints, as the basis of the restoration of
the <i>Labyrinthodon salamandroides</i>, in the Secondary Island. It is
to be understood, however, that, with the exception of the head,
the form of the animal is necessarily more or less conjectural.</p>
<h3 id="c26">Nos. 19 &amp; 20.&mdash;<span class="sc">Labyrinthodon pachygnathus.</span></h3>
<p>This name, signifying the Thick-jawed Labyrinthodon, was given
by its discoverer to a species of
these singular Batrachia, found in
the new red sandstone of Warwickshire,
and which bears to the largest
species the proportion exhibited by
the head and fore-part of the body,
as emerging from the water, for
which parts alone the fossils hitherto
discovered justify the restoration.<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a></p>

<p>In 1844 Mr. Andrew G. Bain, who had been employed in the
construction of military roads in the colony of the Cape of Good
Hope, discovered, in the tract of country extending northwards
from the county of Albany, about 450 miles east of Cape Town,
several nodules or lumps of a kind of sandstone, which, when
broken, displayed, in most instances, evidences of fossil bones, and
usually of a skull with two large projecting teeth. Accordingly,
these evidences of ancient animal life in South Africa were first
notified to English geologists by Mr. Bain under the name of
&ldquo;Bidentals;&rdquo; and the specimens transmitted by him were submitted
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
at his request to Professor Owen for examination. The
results of the comparisons thereupon instituted went to show that
there had formerly existed in South Africa, and from geological
evidence, probably, in a great salt-water lake or inland sea, since
converted into dry land, a race of reptilian animals presenting in
the construction of their skull characters of the crocodile, the
tortoise, and the lizard, coupled with the presence of a pair of huge
sharp-pointed tusks, growing downwards, one from each side of the
upper jaw, like the tusks of the mammalian morse or walrus. No
other kind of teeth were developed in these singular animals: the
lower jaw was armed, as in the tortoise, by a trenchant sheath of
horn. Some bones of the back, or vertebr&aelig;, by the hollowness of
the co-adapted articular surfaces, indicate these reptiles to have been
good swimmers, and probably to have habitually existed in water;
but the construction of the bony passages of the nostrils proves
that they must have come to the surface to breathe air.</p>
<p>Some extinct plants allied to the Lepidodendron, with other
fossils, render it probable that the sandstones containing the
Dicynodont reptiles were of the same geological age as those that
have revealed the remains of the Labyrinthodonts in Europe.</p>
<p>The generic name Dicynodon is from the Greek words signifying
&ldquo;two tusks or canine teeth.&rdquo; Three species of this genus have
been demonstrated from the fossils transmitted by Mr. Bain.</p>
<p>The <i>Dicynodon lacerticeps</i>, or Lizard-headed Dicynodon, attained
the bulk of a walrus; the form of the head and tusks is correctly
given in the restoration (No. 21); the trunk has been added
conjecturally, to illustrate the strange combination of characters
manifested in the head.</p>
<p>A second species, with a head so formed as to have given the
animal somewhat of the physiognomy of an owl, has been partially
restored at No. 22.</p>
